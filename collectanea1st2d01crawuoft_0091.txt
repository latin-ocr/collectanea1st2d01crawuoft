To Ioves high hou» through heavenn bras-paved way,
Drawne os fayre pecocku, that excell in pride,
And full of Argus eyes their tayleu dispredden wide.
Book 1. canto iv. ntanza xvii.

In Marlowe thus :—

Tamb. 1‘11 ride in golden armour like the sun5
And in my helm a triple plume shall spring,
Spangled with diamonds, dancing in the air,

To note me emperor os the three-sold world;
Like to an almond-tree y-mounted high
Upon the lofty and celestial mount
Os ever-green Selinus, quaintly deck'd
With blooms more white than Erycina'ss brows,
Whose tender blossoms tremble every one
At every little breath that thorough heaven is blown.
Then in my conch, like Saturn’s royal son
Mounted his shining chariot gilt with fire,
And drawn with princely eagles through the path
Pav'd with bright crystal and enchas'd with mars,
When all the gods stand gazing at his pomp,
So will 1 ride through Samarcanda-streets.

“2 Tamburlaine‚” IV. iii. p. 66, cols. 1, 2.

So much has been attributed to Marlowe, who
lived but thirty years, that it may be asked, “How
much more ?’' My answer is that I only claim Selimus
. for him, in addition to the plays and poems in Dyce.
Not only so: Ι assert that Marlowe had no hand in
Titus Andronicus or the various versions of H enry VI. 3
and I arn prepared to prove my assertion. In these
dramas Marlowe is merely copied by Shakespeare‚
who is their sole author.
