the influences at work in the minor poet’s writings,
the parallels deserve to be placed on permanent record.

Barnfield not only imitated Shakespeare's poems,
but he alludes to them more than once in his work.
In a piece entitled A Remembrance of some English
Poets he thus praises them:

And shakespeare thou, whose hony-flowing vaine,
(Pleasing the World) thy Praisea doth obtaine,
Whose Venus, and whose Lucrece (sweete and chaste)
Thy name in fames immortal Booke have plac’t.
Live ever you, at least in Fame live ever:
Well may thy Bodye dye, but Fame dies never.
Arber, p. 120.

It is curious to note how fond Barnfield was of the
phrasing and sentiment in the last two lines. They
occur again, in almost the same form, in six other
places In his work. In The Afflctionate Shepheard

is this parallel :—
But Fame and Vertue never shall decay3

For Fame is toombles, Vertue lives for aye.
Arber, p. 18.

And these two lines are repeated word for word at
the end of The Complaint of Chastitie.

Although there is ample evidence to prove that
Lucrece exerted a very powerful influence over many
portions of Barnfield's work, it is nevertheless re-
markable that very few expressions from Lucrece can
be found in his poems. He avails himself freely of
