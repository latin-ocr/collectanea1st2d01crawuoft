his thoughts by other and better precepts than those
of “ pestilent Machivilian policie.” It is quite clear
from his writings that Greene was not an atheist of
the aggressive type that Marlowe was, and that his
argumentative powers were not equal to the com-
position of the singularly powerful plea against re-
ligion made by Selimus.

Marlowe’s irreligious views were notorious among
his contemporaries, and we find one of his enemies,
a Richard Bame or Banes, laying an information
against him on that score, one of the counts in the
indictment being that he (Marlowe) had frequently
remarked “that the firste beginnynge of Religion
was only to keep men in awe'’ (Marlowe’s W orks,
Dyce, p. 389, Appendix ΙΙ.). Bame or Banes asserts
that this was one of Marlowe's “ common speeches,’'
as “ shall by good and honest men be proved ''; that
he preached atheism in all companies, and scorned
both God and man, “ willinge them not to be afrayed
of hugbeares and hobgoblins.” Now, those very words
are used by Selimus in the speech already referred
to, where he says that the names of gods, religion,
heaven, and hell were first devised to make men live
“in quiet awe,” and that religious observations are

Only bug-bears to keep the world insi-ar,
And make men quietly a yoke to bear.
