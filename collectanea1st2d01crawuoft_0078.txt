Thus fai· I have proved that both Locrine and
Selimus were indebted to Spenser’s Ruines of Rome,
that both plays copied the poem, though not in the
same manner, Locrine filching from Spenser in the
most barcfaced manner,and never redeeming its faults
of plagiary by any qualifying touches of original treat-
ment, except such as are often of the most ridiculous
character. The author, indeed, does not stop to con-
sider whether or not Spenser's descriptions will apply
to things in his play, but steals with the haste of a
bungling robber. I have also shown that Selimus is
copied in Locrine in the same bold fashion as Spenser
is, and that Marlowe‚ whilst taking images from The
Ruines ofRome‚ agrees with Selimus and Spenser, and
differs from Locrine, in his phrasing. Neither will
it be overlooked that Ι have not been able to show
that Locrine was under any obligation for material to
The Faerie Queene. If the two plays were by one
writer, we should catch glimpses of Spenser’s great
poem in both ; the absence of such material in Locrine
renders the theory ofa common authorship a psycho-
logical impossibility.

I turn now to the joint relation of Selimus and
Marlowe with spenser.

As was usual at that time, Selimus was printed
without its author's name being mentioned on the
