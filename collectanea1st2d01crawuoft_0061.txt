Α mighty Lyon, lord of all the wood, Edmund

Having his hunger throughly uatisfide S n r
With pray os beaute and spoyle of living blood, “pe se. ’ „
sare in his dreadles den him thought to hide: Locrum,
His uternense was hi· pmyae, his strength his pride, and

And all his glory in his cruell clawes. u Selimus ’5

1 saw a Waap, that fiercely him defide,
And bad him battaile even to his jawes;
Sore he him atong‚ that it the blood forth drawes,
And his proude heart is fild with fretting ire:
In vaine he threats his teeth‚ his tayle, his pawes,
And from his bloodie eyes doth sparkle fire.
“Visions of the Worlds Vanitie,'' 1591, stanza x.

Compare :—

Ate. A mighty lion, ruler of the woods,
Of wondrous strength and great proportion‚

Traversed the groves, and chased the wandering beasts:
Long did he range amid the shady trees,
And drave the silly beasts before his face,
When suddenly from out a thorny bush
A dreadful archer with his bow y-bent,
Wounded the lion with a dismal shaft:
So he him struck, that it drew forth the blood,
And fill'd his furious heart with fretting ire.
But all in vain he threat'neth teeth and paws‚
And sparkleth fire from forth his flaming eya,
For the sharp shaft gave him a mortal wound ε
So valiant brute, the terror of the world,
Whose only looks did stare his enemies,
The archer Death brought to his latest end.
Ο, what may long abide above this ground,
In state of bliss and healthful happiness !
