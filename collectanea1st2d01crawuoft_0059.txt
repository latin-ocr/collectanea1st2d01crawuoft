SEVERAL years ago, when Ι first began to read
Spenser, I noticcd that his writings generally,
but especially The Faerie Qteen, had exercised a re-
markable influence over Marlowe3 and further, that
the anonymous play of Locrine copied whole lines
and even stanzas of the same poet's minor poems,
with little or no attempt at variation. However‚ as
the parallels I was able to gather did not bear directly
upon the subjects Ι had in hand,I contented myself
with merely taking a note of them, and then let them
rest. But some time ago, at the instigation of the
late Dr. Grosart, I obtained a copy of another anony-
mous play, Selimus, and I very soon discovered that
my Spenser-Locrine parallels were of rather more
importance than Ι had suspected3 and a close and
searching examination of Selimus revealed to me the
fact that I was at work on a tragedy from the pen
of Christopher Marlowe.

Selimus, I need hardly say, is generally supposed to
have been written by Robert Greene; and, as regards
