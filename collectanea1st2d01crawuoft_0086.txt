Edmund Pitisul spectacle os sad dreeriment ἒ
Pitiful spectacle of dismal death !

Spenser‚ ‘⁴ , „
Selxmus, 11. 1277-80‚ and ¹295-6·

ιι · ”

Locrme’ Zeno. (viewing the dead). But see, another bloody
and spectacle !
‘⁴ Selimus n Ah, wretched eyes, the enemies of my beart,

How are ye glutted with these grievous objecta,
And tell my soul more tales of bleeding ruth !
‘⁴ 1 Tamb.,’' V. i. p. 35, col. 2.

Observe how beautifully Spenser is varied by both
plays in the following case, and note that the first
line of the Selimus speech repeats a different part of
Spenser :—

Ο Thou, most auncient grandmother of all.
Book 1. canto v. stanza xxii.

As does Tamburlaine in line 6 :—

Enwrapt in coleblack clowds and filthy smoke.
Book 1. canto‚xi. stanza xliv.

But I will quote, and clinch the parallel in the two
plays more tightly together :—

Bajazet. Night! thou most ancient grandmother of all,
First made by Jove, for rest and quiet sleep‚
When cheerful day is gone from th' earth’s wide hall3
Hencqurth thy mantle in black Lethe steep,
And clothe the world in darkness infernal.
“ Selimus‚” 11. 1804-8.

Ο lightsome Day, the lampe of highest Jove,
Fit-st made hy him mens wandring wayes to guyde,
When Darknesse he in deepest dongeon drove3
