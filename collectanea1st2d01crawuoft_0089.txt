cannot endurc, but needes it must be wrackt

On the rough rocks, or on the sandy shallowes,

The whiles that Love it uteres, and Fortune rowes :

Love, my lewd pilott, hath 3 reatlesse minde3

And Fortune, boteswaine, no assuraunce knowes 3

But saile withouten starres gainst tyde and winde=
How can they other doe, sith both are bold and blinde !

Thou god of windes, that raignest in the aeas,

That raignest also in the continent,

At last blow up some gentle gale of ea3e,

The which may bring my ship, ere it be rent,

Unto the gladsome port of her intent !

Then, when 1 shall myselfe in safety see,

A table, for eternall moniment

Of thy great grace and my great ieopardee,
Great Neptune, 1 vow to hallow unto thee !

Baj. You swelling scas of never-ceasing care,
Whose waves my weather-beaten ship do toss ε
Your boistrous billows too unruly are,

And threaten still my ruin and my loss3

Like hugy mountains do your waters rear

Their lofty tops, and my weak vessel cross.

Alas ! at length allay your stormy strife3

And cruel wrath within me raging rife.

Or else my feeble bark cannot endum,

Your flashing buffets and outrageous blows ε
But while thy foamy flood doth it immure,
shall soon be wrecked upon the sandy shallows.
Grief, my lewd boat-swain, stirreth nothing sure,
But without stars ’gainst tide and wind he rows,
And cares not though upon some rock we split ι
