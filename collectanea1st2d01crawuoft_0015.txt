unfinished tragedy; but a wider view of the subject
would, I think, inevitably lead to one of two con-
clusions: (1) Either Marlowe and Barnfield borrowed
from a common source, or (2) Marlowe wrote a poem
in elaboration of his song ‘⁴ Come live with me‚’' διο,
and Barnfield imitated it.

I elect to believe that the latter is the correct con—
clusion; for I have yet to learn that the style of
Marlowe's song is borrowed from another writer. Its
popularity with contemporaries is an argument in
favour of the freshness of its vein at the time it
appeared3 and it is well known that it had a host of
imitators, amongst them being Donne and Herrick.
It is said, too, that the poem attracted the attention
of no less a personage than Sir Walter Raleigh‚
who is credited with writing the reply to it which
appeared in England’s Helicon, 1600.

Briefly, then, I believe that Marlowe wrote a
poem in elaboration of his song3 that he utilized its
materials in his plays, especially in Dido3 and that
Barnfield copied from this poem, which has been lost
or remains unidentified.

Barnfield, like all, or nearly all, other writers of
his time, was very imitative, and he was not only an
ardent disciple of Edmund Spenser, to whom he
admits his obligations, but he pilfered rather freely
