The sar-resounding tormenta ye sustain3

As when almightie Iove, in wrathfull mood,
To wreake the guilt of mortall sins is bem,
Hurles forth his thundring dart with deadly food,
Enrold in flames, and smouldring dreriment.
Book 1. canto viii. stanza ix.

And will you not, you all-beholding heavens,
Dart down on him your piei-cing lightning brand,
Enroll'd in sulphur, and consuming flames?

And, in Thy justice, dart thy smouldring flame, &c.

And bullets, like Jove's dreadful thunderbolts,
Enroll'd in flames and fiery smouldering mists.

Lo ! 1 the man whose Muse whylome did maske,
As time her taught, in lowly shepheards weedS.

Poor prince, thou thoughtest in these disguised weeds
To mask unseen . . . .
. . . . hiding my estate in shepherd’s coat.
