And he shall buy his merriment aa dear
Aa ever cointril bought such oport.
Aet 111. ac. ii. 11. 40-41.

Parker and Anne quarrel, and in reply to the
woman’s request that he should marry her, and so
save her credit and his own, Parker says,

“⁸1 would be twice advised how 1 did wed with such a
strumpet aa thy aelst-‚¹ and then reviled her most nhamefully.
Whereunto shee answered shee had never been :erumpet butfor
bim3 ‘and wo worda thee' (quoth she) ‘that ever 1 knewe
thee, it is thou and no other man else that can triumph in
my spoyle.’ '’

In Arden ofFeversham, Mosbie and Alice quarrel in
like manner, and the latter reviles Mosbie, taunting
him with his low birth and calling. Alice, too, ex-
presses regret that ever she knew Mosbie, and she
uses Anne's own words in the same connexion :—

1 was bewitched : woe worth the hapless hour
And all the causes that enchanted me !

Act 111. sc. ν. ll. 78-79.
Here is the completion of the parallel :—

Mosbie. convey me from the presence of that strumpet.
-Alice, Ah, butjbr thee I bad never been a strumpet.
Act V. se. v. ll. 13-14.

Again‚ Parker tells Anne that he means to keep out
of her fingers as long as he can, because if he were
to marry her she would poison him as she poisoned
her husband. This argument is also used by Mosbie t
