Superfluouu otiu 3 when it were much more honour
They could want necessary ε what need hath nature
Of silver diuheu, or gold chamber-pote?

Of persumed napkins, or a numerous family

To aee her eat? poor, aud wine, she requires

Meat only; hunger is not ambitione:

Say, that you were the emperor of pleasure,

The great dictator of fauhiom, for all Europe,

And had the pomp of all the coum, and kingdome,
Laid forth unto the shew, to make youruelf

Gazed and admired at 3 you must go to bed,

And take your natural reat ε then all thiu vanisheth.
Your bravery was but shown ς 'twae not poeseat:
While it did boast itself‚ it wau then perishing.

Cymbal. This man has healthful lunga. [Aside.

Pennyboy Senior. All that excesu
Appear'd aa little yours, aa the spectatore:
It scarce filla up the expectation
Of a few hours, that entertains men’s lives.
Cymbal. He has the monopoly of sole-speaking.
