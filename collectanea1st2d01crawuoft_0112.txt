Edmund discovered by Mr. Daniel, who announced it in
Spenser, the Athenaeum of 16 April, 1898. Moreover, Mr.
“Locrine,” Churton Collins knew that both Locrine and Selimus
and were indebted to Spenser, and he deals with the
“Selimus '' matter in his edition of Greene. Ι have not yet seen
Mr. Collins’s evidence, nor have I ever had access
to Mr. Daniel's note in the Athenaeum. Nobody,
however, seems to have ever thought of Marlowe as
the author of &limus—3. fact which strikes me as

being very strange.
