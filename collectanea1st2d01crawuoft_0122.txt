till the murder is accomplished. After the murder
of Brewen, Parker was so insolent and overbearing
that Anne

‘⁴ durat not denie him anything he requested, and became so
jelious that, had shee lookt but merely upon a man, thee
should have known the price thereos, and have bought her
merrement deerely.''

Parker

“had her at commandement whensoever he would, and yet
could she scant plcase him with her diligence.''

The play can be made to illustrate the pamphlet
exacdy, even to the phrasing :—

eAIice. (to Amnem) There 's nothing that 1 do can please
your taste3
You were best to say 1 would have poisoned you.
1 cannot speak or cast aside my eye,
But he imagines 1 have stepped awry.
Act 1. ll. 369-72, Dent.

Again :—
nAlicc. (to Ακοῑκ) If 1 be merry, thou straightways thinks
me light ς
If sad, thou sayest the sullens trouble me;

1s well attired, thou thinks 1 will be gudding:
11· homely, Ι seem sluttish in thine eye:
Thus am 1 still, and shall be while Ι die.
Poor wcnch abused by thy misgovernment !
Act 1v. sc. iv. ll. ¹07·¹ 12.

The phrase to “buy merrement dearely,'’ occurs in

a speech by Black Will :—
