he makes Meander attribute it to “the poets.”
Surely he was thinking particularly of Spenser. But
I will quote :—

Mean. Like to the cruel brothers of the earth,
Sprung of the teeth of dragonis venemous,
Their careleu nwordn shall lance their fellows' threan,
And make us triumph in their overthroW.

Mycetes. was there such brethren‚ sweet Meander, say,
That sprung of teeth of dragous venemous?

Mean. So poeto say, my lord.

Myc. And 't io a pretty toy to be a poet.
Well‚ well, Meander, thou art deeply read3
And having thee, 1 have a jewel sure.

‘⁴ 1 Tamburlaine‚’' 11., ii. 47-56.

Of course, I claim that the coincidence of Selimus
and Tamhurlaine borrowing identical material from
the same poem of Spenser is an argument in favour
ofi the Marlowe authorship of both plays. But I
deny that the same argument can hold good in respect
to Locrine, which copies Selimus almost as outra-
geously as it does Spenser. The author of Locrine
merely happened to discover that Selimus had obtained
a small portion of its material from The Ruines of
Rome, and he followed suit, but with less discretion
and infinitely less ability.

The following are a few of the many identities
that can be brought together from Selimus and Locrine.
I could fill pages with such parallels 1-
