These tears, 1 am very certain, never grew
In my mother's milk: rny estate is sunk
Below the degree of sear.

“The Duchess of Malfi,” 1v. ii. 429-31.

Sidney alludes to a quaint saying, breaking off in
the middle ofit; Webster obligingly fills up the blank,
as the following will show :—

“Cecropia grew so angry with this unkind answer that she could
not abstain from telling her that she was like them ebat could no! slecp
when they were sqftly laid.'’ &c.-—“ Arcadia‚” Book iii.

Iulia. You are like some cannot aleep in feather-beds,
But must have blocks for their pillows.
“The Duchess of Malfi,” V. ii. 244·5.

A fine saying in the play is that of Bosola :—

The weakest arm is strong enough that strikes
With the sword ofjustice.
V. ii. 407-8.

It comes from the defiance of Argalus to Amphialus:

‘⁴ Prepare therefore yourself according to the noble manner you “

have used, and think not lightly of never so weak an arm which
strikes with the sword ofjustice.—Book iii.

Sidney says :—

“ Strictness is not the way to preserve virtue3 he had better leave
women’s minds the most untamed that way of any; for no enge will
please a bird, and every dog is the fiercer for tying.”-Book i.

The proverb is not uncommon, yet we may assume
that its presence in Sidney is responsible for its re-
appearance in Webster :—
