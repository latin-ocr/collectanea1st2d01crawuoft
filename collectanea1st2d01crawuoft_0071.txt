of his own plays as Locrine, IV. ii., imitates ll. 1874
to 1990 of Selimus. The action, the order of the
speeches, the incident itself, and the conceits and
sayings by which it is helped out are all remembered.

Now we come to The Faerie Queene, and to the
evidence which not only demolishes the theory of a
common authorship for Locrine and Selimus, but proves
that Marlowe must have written the latter play.

Selimus is full of The Faerie Queene3 but Locrine,
so far as I have been able to discover, never once
borrows from Spenser’s poem. That is very strange,
for Spenser tells the story of Locrine at some length
in book ii. canto x, Beyond that coincidence 1 have
not been able to find anything in the shape of verbal
or other parallel, except in a few cases where Locrine
borrows from Selimus. The age of miracles is past.
If the author of Selimus were also the author of
Locrine, why does he habitually avoid borrowing
from Spenser’s great poem? The answer is plain ε
he is a different man from the author of &limus—a
man who had never read The Faerie Queene.

The first three books of The Faerie Quecne were
published in 1590, the same year which saw the
publication of Tamburlaine. But a portion of the
poem was in circulation as early as 1588, some lines
of book ii. being accurately cited by Abraham Fraunce,
