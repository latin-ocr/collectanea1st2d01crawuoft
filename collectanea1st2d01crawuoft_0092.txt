“ Selimus ’⁹

80

Selimus has all the appearance of being an older
play than Tamburlaine, and therefore it seems to be
the eldest of Marlowe's works. The construction
“ for to'' with an infinitive occurs in Selimus no fewer
than thirteen times, and several times the play has
“for'' in the sense of “because‚'' and other bits of a
phrasing that was fast dying out. This phrasing
occurs but rarely in Marlowe’s other work, but it is
extremely common in Spenser, whom the author of
the play imitates throughout. As a matter of fact,
some of these turns of expression in Selimus can be
proved to have been taken direct from The Faerie
Queene.

Like 1 Tamburlaine‚ Selimus was written with an
eye to continuation, and the remainder of the play
was to follow, provided that Part I. pleased the
“Gentles.” But the “ Gentles ’' apparently were not
pleased, for nobody has ever heard of Selimus, Part II.
The author's own words in his Prologue to Part II.
of Tamburlaine are worth noting in this connexion,
as they show clearly that this portion of his great
drama would not have been written if the public had
withheld their approval from Part I. 2—-

The general welcomes Tamburlainc receiv'd,
When he arrived last upon the stage,
Have made our author pen his Second Part.
