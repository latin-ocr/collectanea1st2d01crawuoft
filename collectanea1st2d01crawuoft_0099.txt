The case for Marlowe as against Greene does not Edmund
need further argument. Spenser,
Marlowe affected a supreme contempt for religion, “Locrine,’'
and he ransacked a copious vocabulary to give that and
contempt expression. In his acknowledged work he “scamus’'
refers to it as a toy, a fable, an old wives’ tale, a mere
sound without a definite meaning; and he tells us he
was ashamed of men who paid heed to such foolery.
I will quote :—
Guise. My policy hath fram’d religion.
Religion ! 0 Diabole!
Fie, 1 am asharn, however that 1 seem,
To think a word of such a simple sound,

Of so great matter should be made the ground !
“The Massacre at Paris,” p. 228, col. 2.

Machiavel. 1 count religion but a childish toy,
And hold there is no sin but ignorance.

1 am ashamed to hear such fooleries.
Prologue, “The Jew of Malta.’'

Compare :—

1 count it sacrilege, for to be holy,

Or reverence this thread-bare name of good3
Leave to old men and babes that kind of folly,
Count it of equal value with the mud.

And scorn religion3 it disgraces man.

So that religion, of itself a bauble, &c-
“Selimus,'‘ ll. 249-52, 255, and 342.
