parison between Solimon and Perseda and The Spanish
Tragedie; and I promise them they will find quite as
many, and sometimes closer, correspondences between
those two plays than any I have adduced from Kyd
in this paper. A common statement to be met with
in editions of men’s works is, “Nobody repeats him-
self so much as So-and-so.” Ι used to think that such
statements were true3 but independent inquiry has
shattered these old idols of the den. All men repeat
themselves, both in speech and writing, and it is these
repetitions that go to make up what is termed “style.”
But all men do not repeat each other as Kyd repeats
Marlowe ε that kind of repetition we dub “ plagiary.”
A man's vocabulary is the surest test by which he
can be judged‚ for no author can jump out of his own
language into that of another without betraying him-
self. His other work will condemn him, and vindicate
the wronged party at the same time. It only means
the exercise of much patience and minute inquiry to
know “which is which.” The proof lies before us
here: the parallels from Marlowe and Lyly are of an
entirely different character from those I have adduced
from Kyd himself. 1 assert, then, that Kyd is the
author of Arden of Feversham‚ and that he must have
composed the play about the end of ι 591 or the
beginning of 1592, just after Solimon and Perseda
was written or revised.
