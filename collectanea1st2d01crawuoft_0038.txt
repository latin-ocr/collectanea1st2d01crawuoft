Kalander to Strephon, who is alluding to Musi-
dorus:—

“ ‘No,' said Kalander, speaking aloud, ‘1 am no herald to inquire
of men’s pedigrees; it sufficeth me if 1 know their virtues‚’·· διε.-

Book i.

The description of Antonio is an imitation, but
a noble imitation, of Sidney's description of Musi-
dorus; and with it Webster has blended words that
appear in the description of Parthenia :—

“and that which made her fairness much the sairer was that it was
but a sair embassador of a most fair mind, full of wit, and a wit
which delighted more to judge itself than show itself, her speech
being as rare as precious,'‘ dem—Book i.

Sidney describes Musidorus thus :—

“ For, having found in him (besides his bodily gists, beyond the
degree of admiration) by daily discourses, which he delighted himself
to have with him, a mind of most excellent composition, a piercing
wit, quite void of ostentation, high-erected thoughts seated in a heart
of courtesy, an eloquence as sweet in the uttering aa slow to come to
the mering, a behaviour so noble as gave a majesty to adversity‚''
&c.-Book i.

Compare the last lines of the latter quotation with
the following :—

Bosola. —she seems
Rather to welcome the end of misen-y
Thau shun it; a behaviour so noble

As gives a majesty to adversity.
“ D. of Ma1fi‚” 1v. i. 4-7.
