light of the evidence that Ι shall adduce, this judicial
proceeding is concerned with nothing more and
nothing less than a quarrel between rival publishers
over the same author's work. On 18 December,
1592, Edward White was fined los. for publishing
an edition of The Spanislz Tragedie, which belonged
by right of purchase to Abel Jeffes; and on the same
date and before the same Court Abel Jeffes was ad-
judged to pay the same sum to Edward White for
unlawfully publishing an edition of Arden quever-
sham, which was the property of the latter. The
Court also ordered all copies of the two pirated plays
to be confiscated. No copy of the confiscated Arden
seems to have come down to us; but there is an
undated copy of The Spanish Tragedie in existence
which may belong to the edition that was in ques-
tion before the Court. It is likely, too, that the
undated quarto of Soliman and Perseda belongs to the
same year as the other two plays, and that they were
the result of Edward White's attempt to profit by
the popularity of Kyd’s dramatic work. It is very
curious that Jeffes and White should have quarrelled
over these two plays, and at the same time; one a
work known to have been written by Kyd, and the
other a play now claimed for him. I hold that this
quarrel is a link in the chain of proof that establishes

‘The
