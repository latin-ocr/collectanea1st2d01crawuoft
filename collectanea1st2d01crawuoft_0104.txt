we find in other parts of Marlowe’s work. Occa-
sionally a whole line of one play is repeated or nearly
repeated in the other. Note, for instance, the fol-
lowing :—
Tamb. And clothe it in a crystal livery.
‘⁸ 2 Tamb.,'' 1. iii. p. 46, col. 2.
AEn. And clad her in a crystal livcry.
“ Did0‚” V. p. 270, col. ι.
And not unseldom we come across bits like these,
which enable us to pick out with precision parts of
Dido that were certainly penned by Marlowe :—

Tamh. But then run desperate through the thickest
throngs‚
Dreadless of blows‚ of bloody wounds, and death.
“2 Tamb.,” 111. ii. p. 56, col. 1.

AEn. Yet flung 1 forth, and, desperate of my life,
Ran in the thickest throngs, and, διε.
“ Did0,” 11. ρ. 2 58, coi. ι.

The scene from which the latter passage is taken is
undoubtedly by Marlowe entirely, and parts of it
copy from Spenser.

Dido also contains repetitions of other pieces by
Marlowe, as the following will show :—

AEn. Threatening a thousand deaths at every glauce.
‘⁴ Dido,'' 11. p. 258, col. 1.

Threatening a thousand deaths at every glauce.
‘⁶ Hero :md Leander? ist Sest„ Ι. 382.
