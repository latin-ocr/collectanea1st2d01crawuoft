Compare :—

O that Ι had the Thracian Orpheus' harp,

For to awake out of the infernal shade

Thone ugly devils of black nabun,—

'rhat might torment the damned traitor's soul !
O that 1 had Amphion's instrument,

To quicken with hia vital notes and tunes

The flinty joints of every stony rock,

By which the scythians might be punished.

‘⁴ Locrine‚” 111. i. 5-12.

“Notes and tunes’'! Does that accord? The
author of Locrine never reaches anything like the
level of Spenser when he attempts to vary that poet;
he tears everything to tatters. We shall have an
opportunity later on of contrasting his methods with
those of Marlowe and Selimus.

I pointed out that the author of Locrine‚ whom I
suspect to be Robert Greene, boldly copied from
Spenser’s minor poems. The further and joint re-
lation of The Ruines ofRome with that play and with
Selimus now calls for attention. Ι will so arrange the
various quotations as to show their mutual dependence
on each other, and will cite passages from Marlowe’s
Tamburlaine to illustrate the contrast between the
methods of appropriation and of assimilation in the
two disputed plays. It will be seen that Spenser and
Selimus account for every line of the quotation I shall
