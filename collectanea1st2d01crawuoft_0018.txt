leave the reader who is interested in following out
such resemblances to a perusal of the play and the
poem; for he will find much more in them than I
can find space to tell.

The Nurse in Dido wheedles the young Ascanius
into following her by her enticing description of the
orchard attached to her house :—

1 have an orchard that hath stote of plums,

Brown almonds, services, ripe sigs, and dates,

Dewberries‚ apples, yellow oranges;

A garden where are bee-hives full of honey‚ &c-
“Dido‚'' p. 269, col. 2.

Then would 1 lead thee to my pleasant bower
Fill'd full of grapes, of mulberrics, and cherries3
Then shouldst thou be my wasp or else my bee.

Or if thou dar'st to climb the highest trees
For apples, cherries, mediam, pearS, or plums,
Num, walnuts, filberte‚ chestnuts, services,
The hoary peach, when snowy winter comes3
1 have sine erchards full of mellowed fruit.
Arber, pp. 8 and 9.

a grove or arbour :—
