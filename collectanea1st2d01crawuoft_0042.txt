The last two lines are from a speech of Pyrocles, who
says he was stunned when he beheld the glorious
beauty of Philoclea for the first time; he could not
take his eyes from her, his sight

“was so fixed there that 1 imagine Ι stood like a well-wrought
image, with some life in show, but none in practice.''—Book i.

An echo of the saying is to be found in The
Devil's Law-Case, which often repeats The Duchess

of M alfi :—
Jolenea. My being with child was merely in supposition,
Not practice. V. i. 21-2.

Philoclea asks Pamela :—

“Do you love your sorrow so well as to grudge me part of it?
Or do you think 1 shall not love a sad Pamela so well as a joyful?
Or be my ears unworthy, or my tongue suspected? What is it, my
sister, that you should conceal from your sister—yea, and servant,
Philoclea?''—“Arcadia,¹’ book ii.

When using this passage of the Arcadia Webster
tacked on to it a reply imitated from Shakespeare :—

Julia. Are you so far in love with sorrow
You cannot part with part os it? or think you
1 cannot love your grace when you are sad
As well as merry? or do you suspect
1, that have been a secret to your heart
These many winters, cannot be the same
Unto your tongue?
Cardinal. Satisfy thy longing,—
The only way to make thee keep my counsel
Is, not to tell thee. V. ii. 270-9.
