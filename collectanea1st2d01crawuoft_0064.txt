S pomer,
“Locrine‚”
and

“ Selimus ''

52

Por all mans life me seemes a tragedy,
Full of sad nights and sore catastrophees.

“The Teares of the Muses,” 1591, ll. 157-8.

And the author of Locrine is so enamoured of the
phrasing that he repeats it in the last speech by Estrild,
Act V. sc. iv, Of course, too, Ate’s “Egyptian
crocodile'’ is identical with the reptile described in
stanza iii. of the Visions qsthe IVorlds Vanitie.

I turn now to Spenser’s Ruines ofRome‚ a poem
that was evidently a favourite of Marlowe, who has
taken suggestions from it for several of the speeches
in Tamburlaine. This poem is also copied in Selimus
as well as in Locrine‚ and, very curiously, the two
plays crib identical lines from it and agree to tack on
to those lines other matter which is not present in
Spenser. But I will deal with a purely Spenser-
Locrine parallel before I bring in Selimus and Mar-
lowe, just to show how flagrantly the playwriter
deals with Spenser's work 2-

O that 1 had the Thracian Pocts harpe,

For to awake out of th’ infcrnall shade

Those antique Caesars, sleeping long in darke,
The which this auncient Citie whilome made l
Or that 1 had Amphions instrument

To quicken with his vitall notes accord,

The stonie joynts of these old walls now rent,
By which th' Ausonian light might be restor’d.

stanza xxv.
