“The complaint.”

And tet dissension 'twixt the son and sire.
“Venus,” stanza 194, 1. 1160.

Those times were pure from all impure complecfion, &c.
“The Complaint.”

To mingle beauty with infirmsties,
And pure perfection with impure defeature, &c.
“venus,” stanza 123, 11. 735-6.

In Cassandra, however, we meet with expressions
taken indifferently from the Venus and Lucrece,

although those from the former preponderate, as they
do throughout Barnfield's work :—

Yoaking his armes about her Ivory necke.
“Cassandra,'' Arber, p. 70.

And on his neck her yoking arms she throws.
“Venus,'' stanza 99, l. 592.

Looke how a brightsome Planet in the skie,
(Spangling the welkin with a golden spot)
Shootes suddenly from the beholders eie,

And leaves him looking there where she is not:

Eveu ⁸0 amazed Phoebus, &c-
“cassandra’' p. 7¹·
