The rare word “ tronked '’ occurs twice in Spenser’s
first three books, and Todd derives it from the Latin
truncatus, maimed or mangled (see Spenser's works,
Faerie Queene, Book 11. canto ν. stanza iv., Rout-
ledge). But it was from the following unnoted
passage that the author of Selimus adopted his word :—

He smott off his left arme, which like a block

Did fall to ground, depriv'd of native might3

Large streames of blood out of the truncked stoek

Forth gushed, like fresh-water streame from riven rocke.
Book Ι. canto viii. atanza x.

Witne⁸s‚ the earth, that sucked up my blood,
Streaming in rivers from my tronked arms!
“Selimus,'' u. 1484-85.

Mr. Daniel has called my attention to the fact that
in the following passage the late Dr. Grosart's edition
of Selimus prints “army” for “warray,'' and he cites
as his authority for the correction, not only a quota-
tion made from the play by Capell, who writes
“warray,’' but the passage from Spenser which Ι
will adduce :—

But after Ninus, warlike Belus’ son,
The earth with unknown armour did army,
Then first the sacred name os King begun.
“ Selimus,'' 11. 323-25.

And, them long time before, great Nimrod was,
That first the world with sword and fire warrayd ς
And after him old Ninus, διε.
