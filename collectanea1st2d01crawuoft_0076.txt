Edmund Note that the playwright used sacred in the sense of

Spenser, cursed. The same meaning is attached to the word
“Locrine,” in one or two cases in Spenser.
and Now for a few parallel passages in Spenser and

“scamus'' Selimus that are not repeated or nearly related to pas-
sages in the acknowledged work of Marlowe 1—-

Now bath the suune with his lamp-burning light
Walkt round about the world.
Book 11. canto ix. stanza vii.

Twice fifteen times hath fair Latona's aon
Walked about the world with his great light.
“Selimu⁸,'’ 11. 41-2.

Deepe written in my beart with yron pen.
Book 1. canto viii. stanza xliv.

Which nature hath inscribed with golden pen,
Deep in the hearta of honourabie men ἱ
“ Selimus,” 11. 2¹8-19·

As when a wearie traveiler‚ that strayes

By muddy shore of broad seven-mouthed Nile,

Unweeting of the perillous wandring wayes

Doth meete a crueu craftie crocodile

Which, in salse griefe hyding hia harmefull guile,

Doth weepe full sore, and uheddeth tendet tears, διε.
Book 1. canto ν. stanza xviii.

Even as the great Egyptian crocodile
Wanting his prey, with artificial teate
And feigned plaints, hin subtle tongue doth file,
’T entrap the silly wanden-ing traveller, διε.
“ Selimuu,'' ll. 448-55.
