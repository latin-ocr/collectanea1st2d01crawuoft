{dentical with those employed in the latter :—

'rhua have we brought victorious Selimus
Unto the crown of great Arabia3
Next shall you nee him with triumphant sword
Dividing kingdoms into equa! ahares,
And give them to his warlike followen.
Ll. 2566-70.

The Prologue to 1 Tamburlaine promises the spec-

tacle of Tamburlaine
Scourging kingdoms with his conquering swerd,

and in several places the play exhibits the Scythian
conqueror dividing kingdoms into equal shares and
giving them to his warlike followers. (See Dyce,
p. 10, col. 1, and elsewhere.) “Great Arabia” is
Tamburlaine phraseology, and the promise of the
Selimus Conclusion is, ifI mistake not, directly asso-
ciated by the author with the speech he puts into
Tamburlaine’s mouth when that conqueror addresses
his victorious generals :—-

But, noble lord of great Arabia.
“ ι Tamb.,'’ lv. iii. p. 28, col. 2.

Tamb. And now, my lords and loving follow-ers,
That purchas'd kingdoms by your martial deeds,
Cast off your armour, put on scarlet robes,
Mount up your royal places of estate, διε.
“ 1 Tamb.‚'' V. ii. pp. 37-8.

These circumstances tell in favour of the priority
of Selimus over Tamburlaine‚ and are worthy of con-

Edmund

Spenser,
“Locrine‚”

and

“ Selimus '’
