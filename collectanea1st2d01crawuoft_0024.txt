ideas and similes from Lucrece, but not unseldom he
clothes them in words that are manifestly borrowed
from the Venus. Take The Complaint os Chastitie
as a case in point. Its theme is that of Lucrece,
and the speaker rails at Lust in exactly the same
manner as Lucrece rails “at Opportunity, at Time,
at Tarquin, and uncheerful Night.'' In Cassandra,
too, the leading ideas of Lucrece are manifest at a
glance3 and the description of Cassandra in her bed,
and the poetical conceit of Phoebus gazing at her
whilst she sleeps, and noting her beauties‚ recall at
once the visit of Tarquin to Lucrece's chamber and
Shakespeare’s description of the bed and its tenant.
In The Complaint of Chastitie‚ published November,
1594, I have been unable to find a single verbal
parallel with Luam, except one which might be
accidental, and which only repeats a saying that is
common in writers of that time. But the poem,
short as it is, is packed with expressions from the
Venus. Here are a few :—

Monster of Art, Bastard of bad Desier,

Ill-worshipt Idoll, false Imagerie, dcc.
“The Complaint.’'

Fie, liseless picture, cold and senaeless stone,
well-painted idol, image dull and dead,
Statue contenting but the eye alone.

“Venu³,” stanza 36, ll. 211-3.
