into two portions, one professing to contain all
Sidney's prose, the other his verse, and neither is
connected with the other. The editor of the prose
Arcadia, in his introduction, says :—

“Wc are told in a sentence which speaks to the beart of a good
man as a trumpct does to that of a soldier, ‘Nature had done so
much for thern in nothing as that it had made them lords of Truth,
whereon all other goods were builded.”’

The sentence is not in my copy of the book, and I
should have missed it if it had not been quoted in
the introduction.

I have no space now to deal with parallels in the
Arcadia and A Monumental Column 3 but I am bound
to mention a discovery I have made since I began
this article. In A Monumental Column and The
Duchess ofMalfi there is a line almost identically
the same. I quoted this line earlier in this essay
(p. 27), and said that it was not in Sidney, although
in his style. It was familiar to me, and I had
a distinct recollection of having read the matter in
the preceding lines of A Monumental Column else-
where. The following will show that the line in
question is copied from Ben Jonson, and that Webster
treats Ben's prose in the same way as he has treated
Sidney's:—
