resembles the reply of Pyrocles to his would-be com-
forter; but as the dialogue between the duchess and
Bosola is from another part of the Arcadia, Ι quoted
at length.

“But she, as if he had spoken of a small matter when he men-
tioned her life, to which she had not leisure to attend, desired him,
if he loved her, to show it in finding some way to save Antiphilus.
For her, she found the world but a wearisome stage unto her, where
she played a part against her will, and therefore besought him not to

cast his love in so unfruitful a place as could not love itself‚” Sec.—
“Arcadia,” book ii.

The lady in this case is the queen Erona, who is
bewailing the misfortunes of herself and her husband.
In her sorrOW‚ says Sidney, one could “perceive the
shape of loveliness more perfectly in woe than in joy-
fulness.'’ These words, slightly altered, help to
describe the duchess in her grief:—

Bosola. You may discern the shape of loveliness
More perfect in her tears than in her smiles.

1v. i. 8-9.
Again :—

Duchess. 1 am acquainted with sad misery

Aa the tann’d galley-slave is with his oar;

Necessity makes me suffer constantly,

And custom makes it easy. Who do I look like now?
Cariola. Like to your picture in the gallery,

A deal of life in show but none in practice.

IV. ii. 34-9.
