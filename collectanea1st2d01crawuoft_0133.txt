one or two cases of similar phrasing and style that
occur in The Spanish Tragedie as examples.

The dread which Black Will inspires in Michael
is so great that the very thought of what the villain
might do to him if he found him false causes him to
cry out for help.

Franklin. What dismal outcry calls me from my rest?
Arden. What hath occasioned such a fearful cry?
“Arden,’' III. i. 88-89.

Hieronimo tumbles out of bed in the same way when
he hears the eries of Bel-imperia3 and, rushing in the

direction of the sound‚ exclaims,

What out-eries pluck me from my naked bed, &c.
11. v. 1.

In IV. iv. 108-10, Hieronimo harks back to the
incident, but says it was his son’s cry that he heard,
although there is nothing in the previous scene to
warrant the assertion. It was Bel-imperia who woke
him, not Horatio. However, this time Hieronimo
repeats Arden more closely than before :—

He shrikesz Ι heard, and yet, me thinks, I heare
His dismall out—cry echoe in the aire.

ι Many passages of The Spanislz Tragedie, in different
parts of the play, would have to be adduced to do
justice to the following in Arden 2—-

Franklin. What pity-moving words, what deep-fetch'd
sighs,
