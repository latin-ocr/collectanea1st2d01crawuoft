What grievous groans and overlading woes
Accompanies thiu gentle gentleman !
Now will he shake his care-oppressed head,
Then fut his ead eyes on the uullen earth,
Ashamed to gaze upon the open world3
Now will he cast his eyes up towards the heavenu,
Looking that ways for redrese of wrong:
Sometimes he seeketh to beguile his grief
And tells a story with his careful tongue;
Then comes his wife's dishonour in his thoughts
And in the middle cutteth off his tale,
Pouring fresh sorrow on his weary limbs.
So woe-begone, so inly charged with woe,
Was never any lived and bare it so.

“Arden,” 111. i. 4¹-55.

That is precisely Kyd's style of describing persons
“inly charged with woe.'' “Pouring fresh sorrow

on his weary limbs,'’ reminds one of Soliman and
Perseda,

Erasms. And add fresh courage to my sainting limmes.
1. i. 52.

Compare Franklin's speech with one of Hieronimo's:

1, now 1 know thee, now thou namest thy Sonne τ
Thou art the lively image of my griefe3

Within thy face my sorrowes 1 may see.

Thy cies are gum'd with teares, thy chcekes are wan,
Thy forehead troubled‚ and thy muttring lips
Murmure sad words abruptly broken off

By force of windie nighes thy spirit breathes3

And all this sorrow riseth for thy Sonne:

And selfe same sorrow feele 1 for my Sonne.
111. xiii. 160-68.
