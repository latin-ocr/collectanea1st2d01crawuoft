υΝΝιΝοΗΑΜέ edition of Ben Jonson's Conversa-
C tions with Drummond of Hawthornden, vol. iii.

p. 486, says :—

“XV. His Opinione of Verses.-That he wrott all his first in
prose, for so his Master, cambden, had learned him.'’

The following is but a sample of the evidence that
I have collected in corroboration of this statement :—

“Money never made any man rich, but his mind. He that can
order himself to the law of nature, is not only without the sense, but
the sear of poverty. O! but to strike blind the people with our
wealth and pomp, is the thing ! what a wretchedness is this, to thrust
all our riches outward, and be beggars within 3 to contemplate nothing
but the little, vile, and sordid things of the world; not the great,
noble, and precious ?”—“Disc0veries : Amor nummi.”

“Nor is it only in our walls and ceilings3 but all that we call
happiness is mere painting and gilt3 and all for moneyz what a thin
membrane of honour that is Ε and how hath all true reputation fallen,
since money began to have any !''—“Discoveries: De stultitial'

Cymbal. 1 am your servant,
Excellent princess, and would have you appear
That which you are ε come forth the state and wonder
Of these our times, dazzle the vulgar eyes,
And strike the people blind with admiration.
