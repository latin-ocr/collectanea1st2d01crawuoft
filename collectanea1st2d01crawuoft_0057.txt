Much of the heavenly virtue, a» procecding
From a pure essence and elected breeding:
Howe'er, truth sor him thus much doth importune,
His form and virtue both deserv'd his fortune.
Lines 23·8.
Jonson is addressing the same Prince Henry whom

Webster laments :—

“When it hath been my happiness (as would it were more fre-
quent) but to see your face, and, as passing by, to consider γους 1
have with as much joy, as 1 am now sar from flattery in professing
it, called to mind that doctrine οἱ some great inquisitors in Nature,
who hold every royal and heroic sarm to partake and draw much to it
qfthe heavenly virtue. For, whether it be that a divine soul, being
to come into a body, first chooscth a palace for itself3 or, being corne,
doth make it ³03 or that Nature be ambitious to have her work
equal; 1 know not: but what is lawsul for me to understand and
speak, that 1 dare; which is, that both your virtue and your firm did
deser-ve yourfhrtune.'¹——Dedication‚ “The Masque of Qeens,” 1609.

Jonson's phrasing and his definition of the doctrine
are taken direct from Edmund Spenser’s An Hymne
in Honour ofBeautie‚ especially from ll. 120-40 of
that poem. A reference to the poem will show con-
clusively that Ben was thinking of a brother-poet's
lines, and not of a dryasdust philosophical dissertation,
when he was paying to Prince Henry the corn-
pliments which Webster copied from him. Hence
Edmund Spenser, in Jonson's opinion, is one of “the
great inquisitors in Nature.'’ For form’s sake I will
quote a few lines from Spenser, and refer the reader

John W eb-

Sidney
