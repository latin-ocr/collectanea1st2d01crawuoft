Locrim, everybody knows the play has been assigned
to Marlowe as well as to Shakespeare.

My copy of Selimus does not hint at any relation-
ship between the tragedy and Locrine, and therefore,
when I found that it actually repeated lines of the
latter which Ι had traced to Spenser years ago, my
interest was aroused. Ι worked the two plays against
each other and with Spenser for all they were worth,
and the results, especially as concerns Selimus, are
nothing less than startling.

When I had got sufficient material together to
enable me to form some opinion of the real rela-
tionship of the two plays, I communicated with
Dr. Furnivall, and he went over a portion of the
evidence with Mr. Daniel, who was not slow to
discover other material in corroboration of my state-
ments, with the result that I was advised to get
my parallels into print at once.

Without further preface, I will at once direct
attention to the parallels in Spenser, Lacr-ine, and
Selimus, merely remarking that it will surprise many
to find that such gross repetitions of Spenser's work
have not been detected long ere this.

I will commence with a few parallels in Spenser
and Lot-rinc that are not repeated in Selimusz—
