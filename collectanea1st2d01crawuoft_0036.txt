familiar she had become with Antonio, who was so
much beneath her in birth. She is, he thinks, a
strumpet, and asks :—

Virtue‚ where art thou hid? what hideous thing
1⁸ it that doth eclipse thee? . . . .
Or is it true thou art but a bare name,
And no essentia! thing? . . . .
0 most imperfect light of human reason,
That mak'st us so unhappy to soresee
What we can least prevent!
. . there’s in shame no comfort
But to be past all bounds and sense of shame.

Ll. 82-95.
Ferdinand’s speech is the speech of Gynecia at the
beginning of the Arcadia, book ii., and it will be
seen that Webster has merely turned Sidney's prose
into verse :—

“0 virtue, where dost thou hide thy-sels? What hideous thing is
this which doth eclipse thee? Or is it true that thou wert never but
a vain name, and no essential thing? . . . . O imperfect proportion
os reason, which can too much foresee, and too little prevent ! . . . .
1n shame there is no comfort but to be beyond all bounds os shame.'·

The duchess replies to Ferdinand's speech by tell-
ing him that she is married, though perhaps not to
his liking, and that his design concerning her future
has been frustrated :—

Alas, your shears do come untimely now
To clip the bird's wings that's already flown !

[Α. 99-ιοο.
