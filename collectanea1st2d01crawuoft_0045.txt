cult task to add to Dyce's list. These repetitions
really form part of a long series of notes, carefully
prepared beforehand, which Webster has scattered
throughout his writings. They stand out from the
rest of his work, and are easily recognized. In old
writings such sentences are often marked by a hand
in the margin, to denote that they are worthy of
more than passing consideration3 or they might be
put between inverted commas, to emphasize their
wit or wisdom. Sometimes they are brought in very
awkwardly, and do not harmonize with surrounding
matter3 and sometimes the speakers follow up their
wise saws by remarks which indicate very plainly
that they are conscious of having given utterance
to something beyond the common. But, whether
awkwardly introduced or otherwise, these notes,
whether cast into the form of proverb-5 or shaped to
rime, stand out from the text and rivet one's atten-
tion. I will deal with some of these notes, and show
that in many cases they should be put between in-
verted commas, not merely to show up their wisdom
or beauty, but because they are actually quotations
pure and simple.

Let us take one of the repetitions noted by Dyce

and trace it to its source :â€”

Contarino. 1 am ever bound to you
For many special favours.
