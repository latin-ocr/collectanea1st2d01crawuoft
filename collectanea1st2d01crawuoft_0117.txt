papers- Kyd, a few years previously, in 1588, at-
tempted to show his fitness for a position in a noble
or wealthy family by translating Tasso’s work on
housekeeping. When one sits down and peruses this
work, as rendered by Kyd, it reads curiously like an
advertisement for a situation ; and, therefore, it is just
possible that his pamplilet obtained him his post. Be
that as it may, Kyd, a servant in a house that em-
ployed many other servants would be peculiarly fitted
to write about servants.

The author was also well acquainted with the law,
as is proved by his familiar use oflegal terms and tech-
nicalities. He opens his play with a speech referring to
a lease of lands, and further on he describes the terms
of this lease in language that can only be properly ap-
preciated by persons acquainted with the draughting
of legal documents. Now, Kyd was the son of a
scrivener, and he was nursed into the occupation of
his father. In his other work the same knowledge of
the law often obtrudes itself on our notice. The
scrivener Kyd, then, could have been responsible for
the legal phraseology in Arden of Feverslmm.

To sum up, Kyd the scrivener and the servant of
“my lord‚” wrote Arden of Feversham whilst he was
in service, and probably towards the end of 1591, or
the beginning of 1592. Now to the proof.
