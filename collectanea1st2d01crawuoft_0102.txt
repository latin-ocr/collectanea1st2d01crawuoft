bride and a place with the gods in heaven. Selimus
would not change places with Hercules :—

This is my Hebe, and this is my heaven.
Line 1674.
He refers to the crown.

In Marlowe’s philosophy might is right, and
tyranny the only sure prop to the throne :—

Machiavcl. Might first made kings, and laws were
then most sure
When, like the Draco's, they were writ in blood.
Prologuc, “The Jew of Malta.”

Sel. And think that then thy Empire is most sure
When men for sear thy tyranny endure.
“Selimus‚’' 11. 240-1.

Moreover, all men are enemies who do not hate, and
actively assist you against, your rivals or opponents:

K. Edw. They love me not that hate my Gaveston.
“Edward 11,’' p. 195, col. 1.

Sel. He loves not me that loves mine enemies.
“Selin1us,’' 1. 23 10.

Note, too, what Barabas says in relation to his
daughter, who enters a nunnery, and calls upon him
to repent of his sins :—

’Tis time that it be seen int03
For she that varies from me in belief,

Gives great presumption that she loves me not, διε.
“The Jew os Malta‚'' Act 111. p. 162, col. 2.

Much is made of this sentiment in Marlowe.
