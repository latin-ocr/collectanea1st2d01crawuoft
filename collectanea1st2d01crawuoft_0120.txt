‘The “The trueth of the most wicked and secret murthering of John
2sluthor· Brewen, Goldsmith os London, committed by hio owne wyse, through
hip of the provocation of John Parker, &c.''

harda! Kyd’s description of the personal appearance of
αἱρέων Anne Brewen is much like Holinshed’s description
dmm„ - of Master Arden and his wife z.-

“Thys Arden was a manne of a tall and comelye personage,
and matched in maryage with n Gentlewomnn yong‚ tall, and well
favoured of shape and countenance‚ &c.”—Holinshed.

“There was of late dwelling in London a proper young woman
named Anne Welles, which for her favour and cornely personage, as
also in regard of her good bchaviour and other commendable qualitieu,

&c.'’—-Kyd.
Note, too, how Kyd commences his description, and
compare again with Holinshed :—

“ There was a Painter dwelling in Feversham, &c.''

Several bits of like phrasing occur in both writers,
and in contexts that are similar: they prove, when
taken together, that Kyd wrote his pamphlet with
his eye on Holinshed. Is not it very strange, if
Kyd did not write Arden of Feversham, that he should
consult the very story that forms the foundation of
the play for material for his pamphlet3 and, further,
that he should put into the latter images, words,
phrases, and ideas that are absent from Holinshed
but present in Arden? Again, why does Arden of
Feversham constantly repeat The Spanish Tragedie
