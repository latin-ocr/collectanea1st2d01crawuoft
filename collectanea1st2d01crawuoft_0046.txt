Leonora. Sir, your fame rcnders you
Most worthy of it.

Cont. It could never have got
Α swecter air to fly in than your breath.

“The Devil's Law-Case‚'’ 1. i. 142-7.
The last line, except for one word, is to be found in
A Monumental Column :—

Never found prayers, since they convers'd with death,
A swecter air to fly in than his breath.

Ll. 221, 222.
The sentiment and its phrasing are taken from the
Arcadia, book ii.‚ where Dorus addresses Pamela in
most courtly style :—

“But most sure it is that, as his farne could by no means get so
sweet and noble air to fly in ns your breath, so‚'’ ἀς.

The passage, as shown by Dyce, is imitated by
Massinger3 but that is not strange, for Massinger
knew his Arcadia almost by heart.

The following is a sentence which reads like a
proverb, but it is only a quotation from Sidney :—

Angiolella. If you will believe truth,
There’s naught more terrible to a guilty heart
Than the eye of a respected friend.

“The Devil’s Law-Casc,·' V. 1. 8-10.

Note Webster's “If you will believe truth”; the
words imply a reference to a proverb generally known.
But I will quote :—
