Their nceptera stretcht from east to wenterne shore,
And au the world in their subjection held.
Book 1. canto i. stanza v.

Ay, though on an the world we make extent,

From the South-pole unto the Northern Bear's,

And stretch our reign from East to Weutern shore,
“selimu2‚·’ ιι. 21-3.

Stretching your conquering arms from east to west.
“2 Tamb.,” 1. iii. p. 47, col. 2.

so from the East unto the furthest west
shall Tamburlaine extend his puissant arm.
“ 1 Tamb.,'' 111. iii. p. 25, col. ι.
The word “glut” with its variants occurs so many

times in Marlowe’s work as to constitute a feature
by itself and a mark by which he can be known.
Note how it comes in in Selimus and Tamburlaine,
although spenser does not use the word in the par-
allel passage :—

⁴⁴ But if that carelesse hevens,” quoth she, “despise
The doome ofjust revenge, and take delight
To see sad pageaunts of mens miseries,'’ ὣς,

Pitifull spectacle of deadly smart,
Pitifull spectacle‚ as ever eie did vew !

Book 11. canto i. stanzas xxxvi and xl.

Ο ! you dispensers of our hapless breath,
Why do ye glut your eyes and take delight
To see sad pageants of men's miseries ?

Edmund
