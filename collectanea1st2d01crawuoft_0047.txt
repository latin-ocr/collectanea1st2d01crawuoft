Pyrodes [to Musidorus} But my wishes grew into unquiet long-
inga, and knowing that to a heart resolute counsei in tediouu, and
reprehension loathaome, and that there is nothing more terrible to a
guilty heart than the eye of a respected friend, &cm—Book i.

Again, note the “has still been held” in the
following :— ·

Leonora. For man’s experience has still been held woman’s best
eyesight.—“The DeviI’e Law-Case,'' 1. i. 200, 201.

Compare :—

Cecropia [to Philoclen} Fur, believe me, nicee, believe me,
man’s experience is woman’s best eycsight.—Book iii.

In the same part of the Arcadia Dorus is said to
have

“wandered half mad for sorrow in the woods, crying for pardon os
her who could not hear him, but indeed was grieved for his absence,
having given the wound to him through her own beart.''

The phrase pleased Webster, hence these speeches :—

Leonora. You have given him the wound you speak of
Qite thorough your mother’s heart.
“The Devil's Law-Case,'’ 111. iii. 249, 250.

Clare. Ο you have struck him dead thorough my heart !
“A Cure sor a Cuckold,'’ IV. ii. 33.

But the parallels with the Arcadia in The Devil’s
Law-Case are few and far between, and utterly differ-

ent from those which can be cited from The Duchess
ofMalfi and A Monumental Column. Very rarely do
we find Webster in the former play imitating the
Arcadia3 he merely quotes from it, or makes use of
