And when the monstrous giant Monichus
Hurled mount Olympus at great Mars his targe,
And darted cedare at Minerva's shield.

My fleeting hosts, and lifts his losty face
Against us all that now do sear his force!
Like as we see the wrathful sea from far,
In a great mountain heap’d, with hidcous noise,
