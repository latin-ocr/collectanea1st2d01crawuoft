Holinshed and the play, the husband dislikes the
taste and colour of the sops, and does not take suffi-
cient of the mess to kill him; but, eventually, he is
dispatched by other means. In the pamphlet, the
poison does its work; yet, in all three stories the
guilty woman, by accident or design, upsets the
poisoned pottage. Alice Arden, after all, does not
marry Mosbie, nor does John Parker make Anne
Brewen his wife3 and, finally, both women are burned
at the stake, and their lovers are hanged.

In the main, we may rely upon the accuracy of
Kyd‘s account of the murder of Brewen; but as he
puts speeches and sayings into the mouths of Anne
Brewen and John Parker that are also uttered by
Alice Arden and others in the play, but not in
Holinshed, we are entitled to assume that he is
merely repeating himself, and quite consciously, too,
in his pamphlet. Moreover, The Murder of John
Brewen copies from Holinshed matter that is omitted
in Arden ofFe-versham.

The title and sub-title to John Brewen can be
picked out in almost the same words from Holinshed :

“About thys time there was at Feversham in Kent a Gentleman

named Arden most cruelly murthered and slaine by the procurement
of hys owne wife.”

Kyd's title reads thus :—

‘The
Author-
sbip of

“ Arden
of F ever—

sham ”
