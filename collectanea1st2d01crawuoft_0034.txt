much about the same time. Dyce thought the play
was first produced in 1616.

But, after all, the question of dates is not of
primary importance‚ and Ι should not allude to it if
it were not for the circumstance that it seems to me
to be involved in the evidence which I have before
me. The Devil's Law-Case copies the Arcadia, and
quite as openly as The Ducbess ofMalfi and A Monu-
mental Column do, but the repetitions of Sidney in
that play are distinctly of another order ; for, whereas
the tragedy and the poem prove that Webster must
have written them whilst his mind was full of the
Arcadia, the coincidences with the latter in The
Devil’s Law-Case have all the appearance of being
notes used after a lapse of time, and when Webster’s
mind was not so familiar with the contexts in Sidney’s
work. In The Devil’s Low-Case Webster does not
imitate Sir Philip Sidney's style, he merely borrows
from him3 in the other two pieces the influence of
the Arcadia is felt in almost every scene and page.
My object, then, is to show that Webster was very
much indebted to Sir Philip Sidney, and this fact, if
it does not add to our knowledge of the dramatist's
life, must of necessity give us more than a passing
glimpse of the man and his methods of writing.
