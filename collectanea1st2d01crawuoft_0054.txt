W..J Craig pointed out to me, agrees with Massinger
in changing Sidney's “eagles” to “eaglets‚” and in
styling the dam “fleme’' :—

Achillas. And, as inspired by him, his following friends,
With such a confidence as young eaglets prey
Under the large wing os their ficrccr dam,

Brake through our troops, and scatter'd 'em.
“The false Onc,’' V. iv.

Massinger has' the same allusion, in almost the same
words, in The Unnatural Combat‚ II. i., and he repeats
the remainder of the speech in the latter in another
scene of The Renegado,aswell as in The Dukc of Milan
and other plays. He was a writer who thought he
could not say a good thing too often. As regards
The False One, it is conjectured that Massinger and
Fletcher wrote the play between them, and there-
fore it is possible that Massinger is only borrowing
from himself, as usual. But that theory would not
account for the great number of other parallels that
are to be found in Massinger and Beaumont and
Fletcher.

The phrase is from Sidney :—
