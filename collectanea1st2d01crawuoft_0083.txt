Compare Selimus with Faustus, as well as with Spen-
ser :—

No no, 1 think the cave of damned ghenta,
Is but a tale to terrify young habe-⁸3

Like devile' sacen scor‘d on painted posta,
Or seigncd circles in our astrolabes.

Lines 428-31.

The comparison could be carried much further,
but what I have said will serve to show how in-
timately Selimus can be connected with Faustus. In
Selimus Corcut the Philosopher seems to be a first
faint shadowing of Dr. Faustus, just as Barabas of
The Jew ofMalta is the full development of Abra-
ham the Jew poisoner.

A long string of parallels could be adduced to
show how closely Marlowe copied The Faerie Queene,
but I have only room to deal with those that con-
nect themselves with Selimus. Yet here is one, noted
by Mr. Bullen, which may be fitly compared with
some of the coincidences I have brought from Selimus
and Spenser :—

He lowdly brayd with beastly yelling sownd‚
That all the fieldes rebellowed againe:

As great a noyse, as when in Cymbrian plaine
An heard of bulles, whom kindly rage doth sdng,
Doe for the milky mothers want complaine,

And fin the fieldes with troublous bellowing.

Book 1. canto viii. stanza xi.

Spenser,
“Locrine,’'
