poem should follow speeches in Dido, addressed to
another Ganymede, the beloved of Jupiter?

Jupiter. From Juno's bird 1’11 pluck her spotted pride,
To make thee fans wherewith to cool thy face.

“Did0‚'’ Dyce, p. 251, col. 2.

With Phoenix' feathers shall thy face be fann'd,
Cooling those cheeks, that being cool'd wax red,
Like lillies in a bed of rosea shed.

“The Aff. Shep.,” Arber, p. 14.
The last line of Barnfield is stolen from Spenser‚

And in her cheekes the vermeill red did show
Like roses in a bed of lillies shed.
“Faerie chne‚'' book ii. canto iii. stanza 22.

Again‚ Barnfield's old man promises his Gany-
mede many gaudy toys and other things

If thou wilt be my b0y‚ or else my bride.
Arber, p. ¹4.

The line, of course, recalls the burden of Marlowe's
song, as it also does the following:
Ganymede. 1 would have a jewel for mine ear,
And a fine brooch to put in my hat,

And then I'll hug with you an hundred times.
Jupiter. And shalt have, Ganymede, if thou wilt be my love.

“Dido,” Dyce, p. 252, col. 1.

It is possible, then, that this poem which I sup—
pose Marlowe to have written was similar in theme
