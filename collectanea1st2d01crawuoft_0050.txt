the strange incident in The Duc-hess of Maffi of

Ferdinand showing his sister the artificia! figures of
her husband and children with Sidney’s story of the
pretended execution of Philoclea, as well as with that
of Pamela told just previously. The dumb shows in
the Arcadia are devised by Cecropia to drive her
victims to despair and to make them yield to her
wishes. In Webster’s play the device is the same:
the duchess is to be “plagued in art‚” and Ferdinand
says he will “bring her to despair.’' Pamela, who
was also a witness of the scene of the pretended
execution of her sister, nothing daunted at the sight,
became more hardened in her opposition to the wishes
of Cecropia, and

“she vowed never to receive sustenance of them that had been the
causers of my [Philoclea's] murther.”—Book iii.

So in the play, the dumb show has the opposite
effect on the duchess to that intended, and she tells
Bosola that she will starve herself to death. Again,
when Cecropia found that her cruelty was defeating
its own ends, she permitted the sisters, who had been
imprisoned in different chambers, to come together
again,

“with the same pity as folks keep fowl when they are not fat
enough for their eating.-Book iii.
