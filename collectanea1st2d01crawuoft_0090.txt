Α restless pilot sor the charge unfit.

But out aias, the god that rules the seza,
And can alone this raging tempest stent,
Will never blow a gentle gale of ease,
But suffer my poor vessel to be rent.

“Selimus‚'’ ΙΙ. 1761-80.

Lest it should be imagined that the author of
Tumburlaine would not avail himself of such lengthy
passages frorn Spenser, I will prove that he did so.
Dyce noticed the repetition by Marlowe of one of
the stanzas that Ι shall adduce—the first one3 but
he overlooked the fact that the continuation of the
speech in Tamburlaine is a free imitation of another
part of The Faerie Queene :—

Upon the top of all his lostie erest,
A bounch of heares discolourd diversly‚
With sprincled pearle and gold full richly drest,
Did shake, and seemd to daunce for iollity;
Like to an almond tree ymounted hye
On top of greene Selinis all alone,
With blossoms brave bedecked daintily3
Whose tender locks do tremble every one
At everie little breath‚ that under heaven is blowne.

Book 1. canto vii. stanza xxxii.

So forth she comes, and to her coche does clyme,
Adorned all with gold and girlonds gay,

That seemed as fresh as Flora in her prime ;

And strove to match, in roiall rich array,

Great Iunoes golden chayre ; the which, they say,
The gods stand gazing on, when she does ride
