PREFACE

With the exception of the article on Ardea of
Feversham, which appeared in the Jahrbuch der
Deutschen Shakespeare-Gesellschaft‚ 1903, all the
papers in this volume were printed in Notes Εἴ
chrie53 and I gladly embrace this opportunity of
tendering my very hearty thanks to Mr. Joseph
Knight and Dr. Wolfgang Keller for publishing
them, as well as for their constant encouragement
and appreciation of my slight but painstaking
efforts to do some useful work.

Whether I have succeeded in my labour is a
point which I must leave to be determined by
those who are competent to judge: all that I
claim now is that there is an ample field open
for discovery in literature by the aid of parallels,
judiciously selected ; and I venture to refer to the
information they reveal in these papers as a sample
of what can be accomplished by this class of evi-
dence when it is sought for with humble diligence,
some knowledge, and a mind not swayed by pre-
conceived notions, or a desire to be at one with
the opinions of most men.

CHARLES CRAWFORD.
