Bosola. Your brothers mean you aascty and pity.
Duchess. Pity!
With auch a pity men preserve alive
Pheasants and quails, when they are not fat enough
To be caten.
“The Duchess of Malfi,” 111. v. 132-5.

I have been thus particular in pointing out a few
of the resemblances between the plots of Sidney and
Webster because I asserted in my first paper that
incidents in the play were founded upon similar in-
cidents in the Arcadia. 1 could pursue the subject
much further, but do not wish to deprive myself of
space for dealing with Webster’s language and pro-
verbial lore.

It is interesting to find that Webster lingered over
his reading of the story of the King of Paphlagonia.
Everybody knows that it was from this story that
Shakespeare derived material for the underplot of
Gloster and his sons in King Lear. Sidney’s king
opens his speech thus :—

“ ‘Sirs,’ answered he with a good grace, ‘your presence promiseth
that cruelty shall not overrun hate3 and if it did, in truth our state
is sunk below tlte degree offertum—Book ii.

The italicized words, slightly altered, appear in a
speech of Bosola’s, and in a scene where the duchess,
like Desdemona in Othello‚ speaks after she has been
strangled :—

John lVeb-
ster and
Sir Philip
Sidney
