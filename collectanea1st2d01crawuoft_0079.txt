title-page. It was allowed to remain in neglect until Edmund
the late Dr. Grosart took it in hand, and included it Spenser‚
amongst the works of Greene in his “ Huth Library,” “Lot-rinc?
1 881-6. It has since been made accessible in Dent’s and
“Temple Dramatists‚’' 1898. “Selimus’'
Dr. Grosart saw that the play was a work of
uncommon power3 and as he had traced in it two
passages that are quoted in England’s Parnassus as
being by Greene, he hastily concluded that Greene
was the actual author of the play. Unfortunately for
this conclusion there is nothing in Selimus to suggest
Greene3 and, as a matter of fact, its atheism, its bold
advocacy of the doctrines of Machiavelli, its style,
and its phrasing are totally dissimilar from anything
that can be found in that writer’s known work.
Again, the editor of England’s Parnassus, which
was printed in 1600, and consists of quotations from
English literature up to that year, was not always
correct in his assignments of passages that he quotes.
He actually gives to Greene three passages that belong
to Spenser‚ and he makes similar mistakes in regard
to other authors. Take two other instances. He
assigns to W. Marlowe, a line which was really
written by John Marston, and which occurs in his
Pygmalion, line 42 :—

“ Loves eyes in viewing never have their fill.·'
