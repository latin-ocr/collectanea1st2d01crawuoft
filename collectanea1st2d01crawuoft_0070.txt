Edmund Acomat. Fortune doth favour every bold assay,

S emer And 't were a trick of an unsettled wit

“p , ’ ” Because the bees have stings with them alway,
Locrum) To sear our mouths in honey to embay.

‘⁴ Selimus ” Hub. He is not worthy os the honeycomb

That shuns the hives because the bees have stings.

Baj. Now Bajazet will ban another while,
And utter curses to the concave sky
Which may insect the regions of the air,

Send out thy furies from thy fiery hall;
The pitiless Erynnis arm'd with whips
And all the damned monsters of black hell.

More bloody than the Anthropophagi,
That flu their hungry stomachs with man's flesh.
“Selimus,'' 11. 1800-1802; 1320-22 ; and 1421-22.

Thus copied in a speech of Locrine :—
Hum. Where may 1 damn, condemn, and ban my fill

And uttcr curses to the concave sky
Which may infeet the airy regions.

Come, fierce Erynnis, horrible with snakes3
Come, ugly furies, armed with your whips3

Or where the bloody Anthropophagi
With greedy jaws devour the wandering wights !
111. vi. u. 8310-11321—22334-35.
