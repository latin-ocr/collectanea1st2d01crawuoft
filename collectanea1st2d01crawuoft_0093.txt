It is possible, then, that the first part of Selimus proved
to be a bad venture, and that Marlowe resolved to
change his subject to one presenting similar aspects
and capable of treatment on similar lines. In Tam-
burlaine we find such a subject, and a treatment that
is identical in all its features with that displayed in
Selimus, even to the minutest bits of phrasing.

The author of Selimus was well acquainted with
the life-story of the Scythian shepherd, whom he
mentions three times in his play. Each time that
he alludes to Tamburlaine, he does so in terms
that instantly recall Tumburlaine :—

For Tamberlaine the scourge of nations.
Sprurlg from great Tamberlzline the Scytthian‘thicf.
“Selimus‚'’ ll. 1754, 2449.
Marlowe thus :—
Of Tamburlaine, that sturdy Scythiam thies.

“⁸1 Tamb.‚'' 1. i. p.. 7, col. 2.

The scum of men, the hate and scourge of God,

My lonl, it is· the hloody·Tam'burlaihe, .
Α stur-dy selon, and a base-bred thies.
“1 Tamb.,¹’ lv, iii. p. 28, col. 1.

Again, like Tamburlaine‚ Selimus is called a scourge:

Occhiali. Selimus
1s born to be a scourge unto them all.
Bajazet. He's born to be a scourge to me and mine.
Lines 480-82.
