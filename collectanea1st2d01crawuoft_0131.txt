Black Will is said to have been “as murthering a
knave as any is in England.” Piston’s saying, slightly
varied, is applied by Master Arden to Reede :—

“lt is the railingest knave in Christendom.”
“Aulam'’ IV. iv. 54.

The hand that drew the picture of Basilisco pour-
trayed the Black Will of Arden also, and this fact is
written large in the two plays3 and he did injustice
to Holinshed’s ruffian in order to make him resemble
his own cowardly bully in Solimon and Perseda. A
fair opportunity of comparing Black Will and Basi-
lisco presents itself in Arden, V. i., and Soliman and
Perseda, I. iii., especially in those parts of the scenes
where the braggarts criticise the manner in which the
sword or lance is handled.

But the plays as a whole must be consulted to make
the resemblance more complete.

Then as regards Kyd's humour, a more perfect
example of it is not to be discovered in any part of
his work than in Arden osFeversham, IV. ii. This
scene leaves us in no doubt as to its author, the
“sporting Kyd” of Ben Jonson's verse. The scene
forms a parallel to that part of Solimon and Per-seda,
