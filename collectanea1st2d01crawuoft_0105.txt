Fame. Sweet Helen, make me immortal with a kias.
‘⁸ Dr. Faustus,'' p. 99, col. 2.

Dido. And he'll make me immortal with a kias.
“ Dido‚” 1v. p. 269, col. ι.

Hence it is apparent not only that Marlowe repeats
himself occasionally, but that the repetitions in Dido
are a certain guide to portions of the tragedy that
are from his hand. That being so,I will now corn-

pare Dido with Selimus :—

Dido. And wilt thou not be mov'd with Dido's words?
‘rhy mother was no goddess, perjur'd man,
Nor Dardanus the author of thy stock3
But thou art sprung from Scythian Caucasus,

And tigers of Hyrcania gave thee suck.
“ Dido‚” V. p. 272, col. 1.

Zonara. Thou art not, false gruem, son to Bajazet3
He would relent to hear a woman weep,
But thou wast born in desert Caucasus,
And the Hyrcanian tigers gave thee suck3

Knowing thou wert a monster like themselves.
'“Selimusss‘ 11. 1235=9

Of course, both plays are indebted here and else-
where to Virgil, who is translated by the Earl of

Surrey‚ thus :—

Faithless ἔ forsworn ἔ ne goddess was thy dam !
Nor Dardanus beginner of thy race !
But of hard rocks mount Caucase monstruous

Bred thee, and teats of tyger gave thee suck.
“AEneid,” Book IV.

But the point is that the passage is used in the same

Edmund

Spenser,
“Locrine,'

and

“ Selimus '’
