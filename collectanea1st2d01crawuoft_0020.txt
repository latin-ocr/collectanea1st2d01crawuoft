just quoted from Edward II. And so on through-
out the poem we constantly meet with conceits and
phrases that can be found in almost the same form
scattered throughout Marlowe’s work. In Tambur-
laine, for instance, is the following :—

Tamb. Like to Flora in her morning's pride,
Shaking her silver tresses in the air,
Rain’st on the earth resolved pearl in showers.
Part 1, V. i. p. 32, col. 2.

Compare with Cynthia :—

And raining down resolved pearls in showers.

Arber, p. 49.

The whole of such passages in Marlowe are in the
same vein, and they stand out clearly from their con-
texts‚ just as if they had once formed part of a poetical
composition resembling the Fragment which Dyce
quotes from England's Parnassus in Marlowe’s W orks,
p. 382, and which was attributed to Marlowe by the
author of the anthology. They seem to have been
copied into the plays to give colour and tone to the
speeches. It seems to me, then, that Barnfield copied
his bits of Marlowe from a lost poem by the latter,
written in elaboration of the song “Come live with
me‚'' &c., and that this poem may be the one that
is partly known to us under the name of A Fragment.
Consequently the Fragment is, perhaps, only a por-
tion of one of the books disowned by Barnfield.
