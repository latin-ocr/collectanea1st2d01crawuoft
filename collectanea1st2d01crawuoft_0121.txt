A comparison between the pamphlet and Arden
will show many concurring particulars, which become
valuable when viewed in relation to the more impor-
tant evidence which now demands attention.

In the pamphlet, Anne Brewen preferred John
Parker to John Brewen; or, as Kyd puts it,

“ Νο man was so high in her books as John parkers·

In Ardm, Alice advises Clarke to go and court
Susam and assures him that his rival, Michael, is
“clean out of her [Susan's] books-'⁹ When Parker
heard that Anne had given her promise to marry
Brewen, he

“ stormed most outragiously, and with bitter speeches so
taunted and checkt her, &c.’'

“ Checked his wife‚” and “ taunted your husband,''
are phrases that occur in Arden of Feversham3 and
when one turns to Holinshed it is possible to trace
a hint for the description of Parker's anger. There
Black Will comes to Greene

“in a great chafe swearing and staring bycause he was so
deceyved, and with many terrible othes, &c.''

Both women, eager to be rid of their husbands, “ put
in practise’' to dispatch him, and they “ never rest''
