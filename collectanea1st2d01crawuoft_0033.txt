seen from the illusions he makes to him in his Monu-
ments of Honour. He styles him “the glory of our
clime,” and selects him from amongst all contem-
porary writers and heroes as the most fitting to
be the celebrator of honour and preserver of the
names of men and memories of cities to posterity.
He had reason to be grateful to Sir Philip Sidncy, as
I shall shOW.

Doubt rests upon the date of The Duchess of M alfi,
which Malone, on insufficient grounds, assigned to
the year 1612 or thereabouts. Yet it seems prob-
able from the evidence obtained from a comparison
of the tragedy with A Monumental Column, written
early in 1613, and a further comparison of both
pieces with the Arcadia, that Malone's date must be
very near the mark. The language and style of
The Duchess ofMalfi and A Monumental Column are
identical; and throughout both the influence of the
Arcadia is persistent, and so palpable that it astonishes
me that no previous writer has ever noticed it. The
Duchess of Malfi was certainly performed before
March, 1 6 1 8-9, when Burbage, who originally played
Ferdinand, died. As I cannot find any of Webster’s
other productions repeating the phrasing and style
of The Duchess of Malfi so closely as A Monumental

Column‚ I conclude that both pieces were composed

John W eb-
ster and
Sir Philip
Sidney
