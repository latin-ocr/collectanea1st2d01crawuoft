John chb- to the poem for the full proof that it inspired Ben
ster and Jonson :—

Sir Phlllp So every spirit, as it is most pure,
Sidncy And hath in it the more os heavenly light,
So it the faircr bodie doth procure
To habit in, and it more sairely dight‚ &c.
Lines 127-30.

There are other parts of A Monumental Column
and The Dur-hess ofMalfi which are borrowed from
Ben Jonson, but the scope of these articles precludes
me from dealing with thern. It is sufficient for me
to claim that I have proved Webster to have been a
royal borrower from Sidney3 and I hope I have
ordered my evidence in such a way as to make it
fairly evident that A Monumental Column and The
Duc-hess ofMalfi were produced about the same time,
and that both were followed by The Devil’s Law-
Case.
