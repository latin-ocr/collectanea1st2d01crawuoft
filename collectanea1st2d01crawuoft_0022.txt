work, pleasing and elever as at times it is, could
never otherwise have obtained for him. It remains
for me to show that there is yet another reason why
Barnfield’s name should be linked with Shakespeare's,
for I find he was a diligent student of Venus and

the two poems as early as 1594, or within a month

speare's work has been found than that which I shall
reveal in Barnfield‚ we may claim the latter to be
the first of his contemporaries to voice the praise
of Shakespeare by imitating him. The discovery
cannot fail to be of interest to scholars3 and as it
serves to strengthen the association between Barn-
