Venus. Now in he fast asleep3 and in thiu grove,
Amongut green brzkes, 1'11 lay Ascanius,
And strew him with aweet-amelling violets,
Bluuhing rosea, purple hyacinthe:
These milk-white dove! shall be his centronel³‚ διε.
“Dido‚” p. 259, col. 2.

And in the ewelt'ring heat of summer-time,
1 would make cabinets sor thee, my love3
Sweet-emelling arbours made os eglantine
Should be thy shrine, and 1 would be thy dove.
Cool cabinets of fresh green laurel-boughs
Should shadow us, &er—set with thick-set yews.
Arber‚ p. 8.

As a matter of fact, Barnfield’s poem repeatedly
reminds one of Marlowe’s song and play; and in
the following instance it copies, or nearly copies, a
remarkably fine line of the opening scene of Edward

II. :—

And in the day, when he shall walk abi-ond,
Like sylvan nympha my pages shall be clad3

Sometimes a lovely boy in Dian's shape,
With hair that gilds the water as it glides,
Crownees quearl about his naked arms, &c.
Dyce‚ p. 184. col. 1.

1 would put amber bracelets on thy wrists,
C rownets quearl about thy naked arms, &c.
Arber, p. 8.

A few lines further on Barnfield has
And when it pleaseth thee to walk abroad, &c.,

which looks like a mere repetition of the first line
