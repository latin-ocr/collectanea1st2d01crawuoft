Ι play, Mr. Bullen remarks: “ Elizabethan litera-
ture abounds in difficulties for the student, but the
question of the authorship of Arden of Feversham is,
perhaps, the hardest difficulty of all.’' It may be
that students have not gone the right way to work;
or, that they were not lucky enough to strike a trail
that would have led them straight on to their goal.
I believe I have got on the right track, and I think
the evidence in my possession warrants me in claim-
ing that I have solved this difficult problem. Arden
of Feversham, according to my evidence, was written
by Thomas Kyd.

As Arden ofFeversham appeared anonymously‚ and
contemporaries are silent as to its author, the ques-
tion is, how are we to decide the matter, what kind
of evidence is most likely to settle the question of
authorship? Ι answer, parallels. But we are at once
confronted with one of Mr. Bullen's difficulties.
“The testimony of parallel passages‚’' he says, “is
like the evidence given by experts in handwriting
