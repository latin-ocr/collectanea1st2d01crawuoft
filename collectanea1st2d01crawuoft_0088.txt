quazer. That woeful emperor first of my name,
Whom the Tartarians locked in a cage
To be a spectacle to all the world,
Was ten times happier than 1 am.
For Tamberlaine the scourge of nations, &c-

Lines 1750-5.

Readers of Tamburlaine are only too familiar with
the spectacle of Bajazeth “locked in a cage.”

In 1 Tamburlaine, IV. iii., Dyce, p. 28, col. 2,
the Soldan compares himself to a pilot in the haven‚
viewing a strange ship rent in the winds and shivered
against the craggy rocks; and he follows up his meta-
phor by the registration of a vow, confirmed with
holy Ibis’s name. The figure and the vow were
suggested by the following stanzas from The Faerie
Queene, which are boldly copied, yet admirably varied,
in Selimusz—

Britomart (viewing the raging sea). Huge sea of

sorrow and tempestuous griefe,

Wherein my feeble barke is tossed long

Far from the hoped haven of reliefe,

Why doe thy cruel billowes beat so strong,

And thy moyst mountaines each on others throng‚

Threatning to swallow up my fearefull lyfe?

O, doe thy cruell wrath and spightfull wrong

At length allay, and stint thy stormy strife‚
Which in these troubled bowels raignes and rageth ryfe !

For els my feeble vessell, crazd and crackt
Through thy strong buffets and outrageous blowes,
