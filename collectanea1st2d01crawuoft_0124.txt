1 may not trust you, Alite:
You have supplanted Arden for my sake,
And will extirpen me to plant another.
”ris searful sleeping in a serpent's bed,
And 1 will clcanly rid my handu of her.

Act 111. sc. v. 11. 39-43.

Finally, the pamphlet and the play both make use
ofa saying that occurs in Kyd many times, that blood
eries for vengeance :—

“-bloud is an unceassant cricr in the cares of the
Lord, and he will not leave so vilde a thing [aa murder]
unpunished.'’ κ

And, again, both passages being from John Brewm:

“ ——the blood of the just Abel cried most shrill in the
eares of the righteous God for vengeance and revenge on the
murderer.''

The following is from the play 1—-

Mayor. See Mistress Ardcn, where your husband 1ies;
Consess this foul fault and be penitent.
Alite. Arden, sweet husband, what shall 1 say?
The more 1 sound his name, the more he bleeds=
This blood condemns me, and in gushing forth
Speaks as it falls, and asks me why Ι did it.

Act V. sc. iii. 1-6.
Compare the Mayor's speech with the speech of
Hieronimo, Spanislt Tragedie, ῙῙῙ. vi. 24-26 (Boas) 2-—

Stand forth, thou monster, murderer of men,
And heere, for satisfaction of the world,
Coqfcsse thysbHy, and repent thyfhult.
