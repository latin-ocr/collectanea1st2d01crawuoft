The wealthie Merchant that doth crosae the Seas,
To Denmark, Poland, Spaine, and Barbarie,

For all his ritches, lives not still at οπεος
Sometimes he feares ship—spoyling Pyracie, &c.

“The Shepheards Content,'' p. 27.

Pain pays the income of each precious thing3
Huge rocks, high winds, strong pirata, shelves and nands,
The merchant seara, ere rich at home he landa.

“Lucrece,'’ stanza 48, 11. 334-6.

The foregoing parallels plainly show that Barnfield
was an ardent admirer of Shakespeare, and it is but
right that they should be put on record, to enable
scholars to arrive at a true estimate of Barnfield’s
work and the influences that assisted to produce it.

I may add that, previous to the information given
in this paper, the first reference to Venus and Adonis
was supposed to appear in the following line from a
poem by Soudrwell, believed to be written in 1594,
published 1 595 :—

Still finest wits are 'stilling Venus· rose.
No evidence, save what is supposed to be contained
in the line, has been brought forward to warrant the
assumption that Southwell was referring to Shake-
speare's poem; but, in the case of Barnfield, we can
point not only to manifest imitations of Shakespeare,
but also to fixed dates, which prove that Barnfield
borrowed his materials previous to November, 1594.
