we are to imagine Mephistophilis or the Evil Angel
acting similarly with the Doctor‚ and with the same
motuve :—

Then gan the Villein him to overcraw,
And brought unto him nwords, ropes, poison, ᾗτε,
And all that might him to perdition draw, dcc.

Stanza 1.
Compare :—
“ Faustus, thou art damn'd !” then swords, and knives,

Poison, guns, haltere, and envenorn'd steel
Are laid before me to despatch myself.

Dyce, p. 88, col. 1, ed. 1604.

When his victims showed signs of wavering, the
Miscreaunt, to draw them to perdition, would show

them
painted in a table plaine
The damned ghosts that doe in torments waile,
And thousand feends, that doe thern endless paine
With fire and brimstone, which for ever shall remaine.

Stanza xlix.

Marlowe did not believe in hell: with him it was

“a trifle and mere old wives’ tale” (see Dyce, p. 87.
col. 1), and Faustus further calls it a “fable” (same
page and col.). Moreover, Spenser’s description of
the torments of the damned is remembered in the
speech of the Evil Angel, p. 1 33, col. 2, commencing

NoW, Faustus, let thine eyes with horror stare, διε.
