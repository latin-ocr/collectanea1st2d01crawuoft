“For Antiphilus, that had no greatness but outward, that taken
away, was ready to fall faster than calamity could thrust him, with
fruitless begging os life,” &oa—Book ii.

When Bosola is about to stab the Cardinal the latter

eries, “O mercy !” Bosola replies:—

Now it seems thy greatness was only outward3
For thou fall'st {aster of thyself than calamity
Can drive thee.

“The Duchess of Malfi,'' V. v. 55-8.

At the beginning of the same scene, where Bosola
enters bearing Antonio's body, the Cardinal greets
him by saying:—

Thou look'st ghastly ε

There sits in thy sace some great determination
Mix’d with some sear.

Ll. 8-10.

Webster's mind was so full of the Arcadia that
he could not help reproducing its phrases :—

“Euarchus passed through thern like a man that did neither dis-

dain a people, nor yet was anything tickled with their flatteries, but,
always holding his own, a man might read a constant determination
in his eyes.”—Book v.

It is not by chance, as I have shown, that Webster
causes the fortunes of Antonio, a man of mean birth,
and his wife the duchess, to resemble at times the
fortunes of the queen Erona and her mean-born

husband Antiphilus. Nor is it fanciful to compare
