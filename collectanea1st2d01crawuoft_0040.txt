the day, he heard one stir in his chamber, by the motion of garments,
and with an angry voice asked who was there. ‘A poor gentle-
woman,' answered the party, ‘that wish[es] long life unto you.'
‘And 1 soon death unto you,’ said he, ‘for the horrible curse you
have given me.’”—“Arcadia,” book iii.

1 account this world a tedious theatre‚
For 1 do play a part in’t against my will.
Bosola. Come, be of comfort, 1 will save your life,
Duch. Indeed, 1 have not leisure to tend
So small a business.
Bos. Νοψ, by my life, 1 pity you.
Duch. Thou art a fool, then,
To waste thy pity on a thing so wretched
As cannot pity itself . . . .

Serv. One that wishes you long life.

Duch. 1 would thou wert hang'd for the horrible curse
Thou hast given me. 1v. i. 100-14.
