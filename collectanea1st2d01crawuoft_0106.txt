manner in each play, that it is translated in the
same language, and reflects vividly the sels-same
style. It corroborates the other evidence that I
have adduced in favour of Marlowe as the sole
author of Selimus; and it tends to show that portions
of Dido and Selimus were composed about the same
time. The lines are paralleled again in Edward IL,
p. 219, col. 2, where the king tells Lightborn that
the story of what he (the king) has had to endure
would melt a heart hewn from the Caucasus, and
make it relent at his misery.

For style and phrasing compare the following,
and note how Guise and Selimus echo each other
again :-—-

Guise. Lct mean conceits and baser men fenr death ι

Tut‚ they are peasants3 I am Duke of Guise.
“Massacre at Paris,” p. 242, col. ι.

Selimus. Le! Mahound’s lawe be locked up in their case,
And meaner men and of a baser spirit,
In virtuous actions seek for glorious merit,
1 count it, ἀς. “ Selimus,’' 11. 246-9.

Guise. 1 am ajuror in the holy league,
And therefore hated of the protestants :
What should 1 do but stand upon my guard?
“Massacre of Paris‚'' p. 240, col. 1.

Sel. But for 1 see the Schoolmen are prepnr'd
To plant 'gainst me their bookish ordinancc,
1 mean to stand on a sententious guard.
“Selimus‚'' 11. 303-5.
