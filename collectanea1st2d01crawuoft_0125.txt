To conclude this part of the case, I think we may
say with certainty that Kyd in John Brewen took as his
model for the pamphlet the narrative of the murder
of Arden in Holinshed3 and that he made fanciful
additions to it by associating its main incidents with
similar incidents in Arden of Feversham, which we
know but too well very faithfully follows the terribly
dramatic story told by Holinshed. Ῑ turn now to
Kyd’s plays,

An exhaustivc and painstaking examination of
Kyd's work as a whole convinces me that The
Spanish Trageclie, and, perhaps, Soliman and Perseda,
as we know them now, are old plays revised. How-
ever that may be, it can be proved that they did not
assume any of their known forms prior to the year
1 590. Soliman and Perseda was either wholly written
about 1591, or it was thoroughly overhauled in that
year. These two plays copy matter from Edmund
Spenser, Thomas Watson, Christopher Marlowe, and
others; and what they borrow enables us to say with
confidence that they borrowed part of it after 1590.
It is to be found in all known editions of the plays.
As regards order, Arden of Feversham follows Soli-
man and Perseda, and it must have followed it very
closely, because the two plays use the same vocabulary
throughout.
