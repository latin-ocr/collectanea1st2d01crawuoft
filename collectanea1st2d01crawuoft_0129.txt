Y. Mort. 1 tell thee, 'tin not meet that one uo false
Should come about the person of a prime.—
“Edward 11,·' p. 216, col. ι.

Finally, to show how intimately soliman and Perseda
and Arden of Feversham are related to each other, I
quote the following. It will be seen that the former
play follows Marlowe closely, whereas Arden ofFever-
sham merely echoes him3 yet, Arden repeats Solimun
and Perseda phrasing which was not borrowed from

Edward I I .

K. Edw. 1 here create thee Lord mgb-chamberlain,
chief Secretary to the state and me,
Earl of Cornwall‚ King and Lord of Man.
Ga'v. My lord, these titles sar exceed my worth.
Kent. Brother, the least of these may well suffice

For one of greater birth than Gaveston.
“Edward 11‚” p. 185, col. 1.

Sol. Thou shalt be Captaine os our Janisaries,
And in our Counsell shalt thou sit with us,
And be great Solimans adopted friend.

Erase. The least of these surpasse my best desart,

Unless true loyaltie may seeme desart.
“ Sol. and Pers.,” 111. i. 98-102.

Thus in Arden :—

auia. But my deserts or your desires decay,
Or both3 yet ff true love may seem desert,
1 merit stin to have thy company.
‘⁴ Arden,’' 1v. i. ¹7-19·

These borrowings from Marlowe tend to show that
soliman and Perseda is a little older, as regards com-
