P. Canter. Why that's the end of wealth Ξ thrust riches outward,
And remain beggars within ς contemplate nothing
But the vile, sordid things of time, place, money,
And let the noble and the precious go:
Virtue and honesty3 hang them, poor thin membranes
Os honour ! who respects them? 0, the fates,
How harh all just true reputation fallen,

Since money, this base money, ’gan to have any Ξ
“The Staple of News,” 111. i·

“We covet superfluous things, when it were more honour for us,
if we would contemn necessary. What need hath nature of silver
dishes, multitudes of waiters‚ delicate pages, persumed napkins? she
requires meat only, and hunger is not ambitious . . . . Ο ! if a man
could restrain the fury of his gustet, and groin, and think how many
fires, how many kitchens, cooks, pastures, and ploughed lands3 what
omhards, stews‚ ponds, and parks, coops and garners, he could spare;
what velvets, tissues, embroideries, laces, he could lack3 and then
how short and uncertain his life is3 he were in a better way to happi-
ness, than to live the emperor of these delights, and be the dictator
of fashions . . . . Have not 1 seen the pomp of a whole kingdom,
and what a foreign king could bring hither? Also to make himself
gazed and wondered at, laid forth as it were to the shew, and vanish
all away in a day? And shall that which could not fill the expecta-
tion of few hours, entertain and take up our whole lives? when even
it appeared as superfluous to the possessore, as to me that was a
spectator. The bravery was shewn, it was not possessed; while it
boasted itself, it perished.’'—“Discoveries= Amor nummi.”

Pennybqy Senior. Who can endure to see
The fury of men's gullets, and their groins?
What fires, what cooks, what kitchens might be spared !
what stews‚ ponde, parks, coops, garners, magazines!
What velvets, tissues, scarsa, embrofflerieu,
And laces they might lack! They covet things
