replies:—

Why, ignorante

In courtship cannot make you do amisa,

“The Duchess of Malfi‚'' V. ii. 197-9.

A part of the speech is taken from Sidney's charm-
ing description of Lalus, one of many perfect gems
in writing to be found in the Arcadia :—

He had nothing upon him but a pair of slops, and upon his body
a goatskin, which he cast over his shoulder, doing all things with so
pretty a grace that it seemed ignorance could not make him do amiss

because he had a beart to do well.”-—Book i.

The last speech in The Duchess of Malfi has this
beautiful sentiment, which Webster claims as if it
were an old companion :—

Delio. 1 have ever thought

Nature doth nothing so great for great men
As when she’s pleased to make thern lords of truth.
“The Duchess of Malfi‚‘¹ V. v. ¹44-6·

It may be that a perfect copy of the Arcadia will
show that not only these lines, but other parts of the
speech in the play, are stolen. My Arcadia is split
