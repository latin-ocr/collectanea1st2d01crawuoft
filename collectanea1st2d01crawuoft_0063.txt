Αη hideoua Drngon, dreadfull to behold, Edmund
whose backe wau arm'd against the dint of upeare S

With ahielda os branse that ahone like burnisht golde, “penses'' „
And forkhed sting that death in it did beare, Locrme,
strove with a Spider hia unequall peare; and

And bad defiance to his enemie. ιι seh-mus n

The subtill vermin, creeping closely neare,

Did in his drinke shed poyson privilie3

Which, through his entrailes spredding diversly,
Made him to swell, that nigh his bowells brust,
And him enforst to yeeld the victorie,

That did so much in his owne greatnesse trust.

Thus in Locrine :—

Ate. High on a bank, by Nilus' boisterous streame,
Fearfully sat the Egyptian crocodile,
Dreadfully grinding in her sharp long teeth
The broken bowels of a silly fish.
His back was arm'd against the dint of spear,
With shields of brass that shined like burnish’d gold :
And as he stretched forth his cruel paws,
A subtle adder creeping closely near,
Thrusting his forked sting into his claws,
Privily shed his poison through his bones,
Which made him swell‚ that there his bowels burst,
That did so much in his own greatness trust.

Mark what ensues, and you may easily see

That all our life is but a tragedy.
“Dumb Sbow,'' 111.

As in the case of the previous Dumb Show, so here
the conclusion of Ate’s speech is under obligation to
another poem of Spenser’s :—
